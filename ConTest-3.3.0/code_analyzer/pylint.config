# Python expression which should return a note less than 10 (10 is the highest
# note). You have access to the variables errors warning, statement which
# respectively contain the number of errors / warnings messages and the total
# number of statements analyzed. This is used by the global evaluation report
# (RP0004).

# PyLint limits no. of args to 5 which is some complex cases is too low, therefore it's increased

# E.g. we want to allow "TODO" items without breaking our pylint score
# Temporary disable duplicate code checks until new ui controller is merged to master.
