    #        FOR PROPER DOCUMENTATION AND ERROR REPORTING
    from contest_verify.verify import contest_asserts
    from contest_verify.verify import contest_expects
    from ptf.ptf_utils.report import *
    from ptf.ptf_utils.global_params import get_parameter

and store them for documentation and traceability purpose.


Can I run or execute T32 PRACTICE scripts in ConTest?
*****************************************************

Yes, you can execute T32 PRACTICE scripts in ConTest. |br|
You can either use T32 API **run_t32_script** to execute your script or if your script is written as
test case then you can select that script on ConTest GUI. |br|
For later case refer to T32_Script_Tests_. |br|
In order to select CMM test cases on GUI you should mention CMM test scripts location in ConTest configuration.


Can I run CANoe test modules in ConTest?
****************************************

Yes, you can run CANoe Test Modules (xml modules or DIVA generated) in ConTest. |br|
You should mention the location of these modules in CAPL test location field in ConTest configuration. |br|
The test modules will be shown on ConTest GUI (similar to CANoe test module view) for selection. |br|
You can select which test module or test case to run or execute and press **Run** on ConTest GUI
for execution. |br|
ConTest will monitor the execution status of test modules and report status on console. |br|
