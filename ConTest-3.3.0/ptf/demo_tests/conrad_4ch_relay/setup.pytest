        - global_setup(): Will be called before ALL test-cases
        - setup(): Will be called before EACH test-case
        - teardown(): Will be called after EACH test-case. Will also be called if test-case fails.
        - global_teardown(): Will be called after ALL test-cases.
                             Will be called if any execution before fails.
