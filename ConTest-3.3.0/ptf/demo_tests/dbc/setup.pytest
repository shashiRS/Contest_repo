    This file contains the (global_)setup and (global_)teardown methods.
    Copyright 2019 Continental Corporation

    This file contains up to four methods that will be called by the test framework:
        - global_setup(): Will be called before ALL testcases
        - setup(): Will be called before EACH testcase
        - teardown(): Will be called after EACH testcase. Will also be called if testcase fails.
        - global_teardown(): Will be called after ALL testcases.
                             Will be called if any execution before fails.
